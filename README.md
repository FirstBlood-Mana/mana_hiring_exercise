# Mana Flutter Hiring Exercise

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for your Flutter application.

It's basically a "new/empty project," with a README.md file containing the exercise descriptionâ€”nothing else.

## Exercise

You should use Rick and Morty REST API to:

1 - Show A Page with a list containing all the characters once the user opens the app

2 - Show A Second Page, showing the character's details information after the user taps one item of the list

Useful links:

- [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/)
- [Character's Endpoint](https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character)

## Requirements

The exercise is really easy; the idea here is to focus on your code instead of the problem. But we do expect to see code quality. Here are some points you can explore:

- Set up product flavors for different development environments
  - At least 2 environments (Production and Development)
- Use an app Arquitecture
  - Code should be SOLID and decoupled
  - Don't forget, an app is much more than only a beautiful UI ;)
- Use one State Management library
  - We use BLOC, but feel free to use another
  - Don't forget, these libs are just facilitators. You can don't use any of these, but we want to be sure you know how to manage the Widget tree properly.
- Code should be Testable. Try to create some:
  - Unit tests
  - Integration tests
  - Widget tests (if it makes sense and you have time)
- Make the app work offline, including some local cache
- Explore Animations || Page Transitions
  - Be creative here; we don't expect anyone to be a new "Leonardo da Vinci" when creating the UI. We only want to see that you know how the Flutter framework handles these kinds of things.

## How you will be ranked

Changes are that you'll be initiating a new project when starting at this position. So we want to be sure you know how to create code that scales, it's maintainable, decoupled, and avoids [software rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot).

We will look at

- User experience in general
- Code quality and organization
- Commits quality
- Pull request commenting quality
- All tests pass

If you don't know how to handle all the Requirements, it's ok. Do everything you can, the best way you can :)
